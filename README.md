# betterlockPlus
Cinnamon applet for lock keys, display brightness, keyboard brightness

**NumLock**, **CapsLock**, **ScrollLock** have icon buttons in the system tray.
They can be toggled by clicking.
There are optional popup notifications intended to avoid typing
unwanted uppercase text or other inconveniences.

Laptops/Notebooks benefit of additional display brightness icon button,
as well as keyboard brightness button where available.
The latter is experimental and untested (no matching hardware).

Size and positioning of the icon buttons is quite flexible, especially
for panels of large height.
